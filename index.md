## About Me

I am Kaylee. I am a 11th grade high school student learning to code.

## About My Project

For my final project, I plan to complete gain five stars from doing different programming problems from Advent of Code (AoC). I think AoC also offers a great opportunity to review and consolidate the material Iâ€™ve learned this semester.
