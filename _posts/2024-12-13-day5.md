title: Day 5

I attempted to solve Problem 4, which required determining the total number of times "XMAS" appears in the word search. Right away, I noticed that this problem resembled the Row/Col Major problem from a previous mission, so I thought I could apply some of the same techniques. I tried to create five functions: one to count all the "XMAS" instances horizontally, one for vertically, two for diagonally (one leftward, one rightward), and one to sum these counts together. For each of these functions, I aimed to sort the elements into these corresponding major orders to make the counting more straightforward. However, I ran into difficulties with organizing the diagonals and ultimately gave up for the day. I plan to return to this problem soon and hope to figure it out.
