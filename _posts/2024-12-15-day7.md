Today, I worked on Problem 2 Part 2: find the total number of safe rows but allow for one defective. To accomplish this, I counted all the rows that were initially unsafe but would become safe if the dampener were applied, and then added that value to the rows that were already safe. Initially, I lumped the code for my functions is_level_safe and total_safe together as one function, but I realized I needed to separate them so that I could call on them separately. This problem, overall, was very enjoyableâ€”not too challenging. After finishing the problem, I also looked online to see how others had approached the problem; I saw that someone used NumPy, which looked pretty cool. As a personal goal, I want to learn a bit more about NumPy on my own time.

I realize that at the rate the I am working through these problems, I won't be able to finish 5 Advent of Code problems and gain 10 stars (original goal); I will aim for 5 stars instead.
