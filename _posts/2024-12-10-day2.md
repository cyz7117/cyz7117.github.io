I worked on Part 1 of Problem 1 of Advent of Code 2024. Specifically, I wrote a function that determines the total "distance" between two integer lists of equal length by first pairing corresponding sorted elements and then summing the absolute differences between each pair. It felt quick and simple; it just combined a few concepts we learned from early Trainings. I actually found the challenging part to be formating the puzzle input in a way that my function could use. I spent a significant amount of time trying to figure out how to sort each input into the correct list. The extra spacing between the left and right inputs made the process confusing. I felt a bit defeated that I could not figure it out. I hope to ask Lux for help tomorrow and resolve the issue soon.
