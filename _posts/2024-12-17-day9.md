title: Day 9

I met Lux at office hours at 7 pm to discuss my code. It took longer than expected—almost 2 hours instead of 1. I was confused by Lux’s suggestions at first, but it became clearer when she wrote comments describing her idea. Basically, after calculating where the next letter should be, we wrote a code to check if the location was within scope (a lot more efficient for the computer than the buffer).
Also, I did attempt Part 2 of Problem 4 (find the amount of times 2 MASs appear in the shape of an X in the word search) prior to office hours but could not successfully implement it. My approach was to find the “A” (middle character) and check the characters diagonally adjacent to it. The project is almost due, so I don’t have time to do Part 2, but it is something I would like to continue working on my own time as a goal.
