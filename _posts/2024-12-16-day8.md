I went back to trying Problem 4 Part 1. I gave my approach some thought, and I decided that it would be simpler to search for “X” as the first letter and see if there was any “MAS” connected to it. When I first started implementing this solution, I ended up with a very long series of if statements (one for each of the eight directions to check for). Unsatisfied with how it looked, I went online for inspiration (because I had no ideas for how to effectively approach this) and found a video where the guy establishes a variable that stores the directions in the very beginning. My code looked a lot less redundant-looking after implementing the guy’s method. However, when running my code, I received a string index out of range error. Checking all the directions for the Xs on the edges would mean checking out of the frame sometimes. To avoid going out of frame, I decided to make a buffer border 3 dots thick. Though it worked (super happy about that), it looked a little inefficient for the computer. Tomorrow, I hope to talk with Lux about my code to see if we can improve it.
