Originally, I planned to try Problem 7, but after struggling with Problem 4, I decided it would be more beneficial for me to focus on completing both parts of Problem 2. Part 1 required determining the number of "safe" rows, where a row is considered safe if the integers are either all increasing or all decreasing, and if the difference between any two adjacent numbers is at least 1 and at most 3. To solve this, I broke the problem into three parts: first, verifying that each row was either strictly increasing or decreasing by comparing the sorted version of the row with the original; second, ensuring that the absolute difference between adjacent numbers fell between 1 and 3 (inclusive); and third, counting the rows that number of rows that meet both conditions. I ran into logic errors during testing, which made debugging frustrating. After rereading my code multiple times, I realized that I hadn’t converted the elements in the lists to integers, which was affecting the comparison results. I hadn’t considered that "100" is less than "99" in string comparison in ASCII. This problem emphasizes the importance of using correct data types, a concept that is also emphasized throughout our Trainings. I hope to finish Part 2 by tomorrow and apply this insight to improve my future debugging process.
