I met up with Lux on Zoom to figure out the issue I encountered from Day 2. Lux suggested using split(), a built-in method that returns a list of substrings from a string (new concept for me). She also recommended adding the first index to the left list and the last index to the right list. As a result, my code was able to run properly, so I was really happy about that. At the end of the meeting, Lux recommended that I should, on my own time, explore pandas, another way to approach the first problem, so I put it as a goal. After I submitted my solution (got the answer correct), I learned that each problem had a Part Two, which I had not realized before. So, I went ahead and did it. The task wasnâ€™t particularly challenging, and I was able to complete it without much trouble. I just implemented a nested for loop to check for matches in the right list for each element in the left list.
